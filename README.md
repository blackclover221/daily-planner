# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## What went well
Gained practical experience in front-end web development, incorporating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and external libraries to create a functional and visually appealing daily planner. Demonstrated an understanding of key concepts like local storage, dynamic styling, and event handling.


## Challenges 
- fixing the folder structure as it has impacted my deployment, which made me not do so well first time I submitted this challenge.
